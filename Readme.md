# Mayhem - API Chaos Engineering Tool

üî• API Chaos Engineering Tool üî•

Mayhem is a chaos engineering tool for APIs that allows you to inject controlled failures, delays, and timeouts into your HTTP services to test their resilience.

## What is Chaos Engineering?

Chaos engineering is the practice of intentionally introducing failures into your system to identify weaknesses before they cause outages in production. Mayhem makes this easy by providing a simple proxy that can inject delays, errors, and timeouts without modifying your application code.

Think of it as a "vaccine for your API" - by exposing your system to small, controlled doses of failure, you build immunity against larger, unexpected outages.

## Features

Mayhem provides three main types of chaos injection:

1. üêå Delay Injection: Introduces random delays to simulate network latency or slow dependencies

2. üí• Error Injection: Returns HTTP error codes to test error handling

3. ‚è±Ô∏è Timeout Injection: Simulates request timeouts to test timeout handling

## Installation

You can install using following command

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pgaijin66/mayhem/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
# or

wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pgaijin66/mayhem/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

## Basic Usage

To start Mayhem with default settings, you need to specify a target service:

```
./mayhem -target=http://localhost:3000
```

What this does:
- Starts Mayhem on port 8080
- Proxies requests to your service running on port 3000
- Injects delays 10% of the time
- Injects errors 5% of the time
- Injects timeouts 2% of the time

## Custom Configuration

You can customize the chaos behavior using command-line flags:

```
./mayhem \
  -target=http://api.example.com \
  -port=9000 \
  -delay-prob=0.2 \
  -delay-min=500ms \
  -delay-max=3s \
  -error-prob=0.1 \
  -error-codes=500,503,504 \
  -timeout-prob=0.05 \
  -timeout-dur=10s
```
This configuration:

1. Runs Mayhem on port 9000
2. Targets api.example.com
3. 20% delay probability (500ms to 3s delays)
4. 10% error probability (returns 500, 503, or 504 errors)
6. 5% timeout probability (10s timeouts)

You can generate configuration file using `make config-example`

## Configuration Options

### JSON Configuration File
You can also use a JSON configuration file for more complex setups. Create a file like `chaos-config.json`:

```
{
  "delay_enabled": true,
  "delay_min": "600ms",
  "delay_max": "2s", 
  "delay_probability": 0.2,
  "error_enabled": true,
  "error_codes": [500, 502, 503, 504],
  "error_probability": 0.1,
  "error_message": "Chaos engineering fault injection",
  "timeout_enabled": true,
  "timeout_duration": "30s",
  "timeout_probability": 0.05
}
```

Then run Mayhem with the configuration file:

```
./mayhem -target=http://localhost:3000 -config=chaos-config.json
```

üí° Note: The JSON configuration will override any command-line flags you specify.

### Management Endpoints

Mayhem provides several management endpoints for monitoring and controlling chaos injection:

```
curl http://localhost:8080/_chaos/health
```

### Health Check

Returns the current health status and target information:

```
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "chaos": "enabled", 
  "timestamp": "2025-07-20T17:42:30Z",
  "target": "http://localhost:3000"
}
```

### Statistics

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/_chaos/stats
```

Provides detailed statistics about chaos injection:

```bash
json{
  "total_requests": 1000,
  "delays_injected": 98,
  "errors_injected": 52,
  "delay_percentage": 9.8,
  "error_percentage": 5.2,
  "uptime": "2h15m30s",
  "config": { ... }
 }
```

### Configuration Management
```
# Get current configuration
curl http://localhost:8080/_chaos/config

# Update configuration
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/_chaos/config \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"delay_probability": 0.3, "error_
```

üí° Note: You can dynamically update the chaos configuration without restarting Mayhem, making it easy to adjust chaos levels during testing.

# Usage Examples

## Testing API Resilience

Start your API on port 3000 and Mayhem on port 8080:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start your API
node server.js

# Terminal 2: Start Mayhem
./mayhem -target=http://localhost:3000 -delay-prob=0.3 -error-prob=0.1

# Terminal 3: Send test requests through Mayhem
curl http://localhost:8080/api/users
```

What happens: Your application will receive requests through Mayhem, which will randomly inject delays and errors based on the configured probabilities.


### Load Testing with Chaos

Combine Mayhem with load testing tools to simulate real-world conditions:

```
# Start Mayhem with moderate chaos
./mayhem -target=http://localhost:3000 -delay-prob=0.2 -error-prob=0.05

# Run load test through Mayhem
hey -n 1000 -c 10 http://localhost:8080/api/endpoint

```

Result: This tests how your API performs under load while experiencing realistic network issues.

### Gradual Chaos Increase
You can gradually increase chaos levels during testing:

```
# Start with low chaos
./mayhem -target=http://localhost:3000 -delay-prob=0.1 -error-prob=0.02

# Increase error rate during testing
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/_chaos/config \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"error_probability": 0.1}'

# Further increase chaos
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/_chaos/config \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"delay_probability": 0.3, "error_probability": 0.2}'
```


### Testing Specific Failure Scenarios

Focus on specific types of failures:

```
# Test timeout handling only
./mayhem -target=http://localhost:3000 \
  -delay-prob=0 \
  -error-prob=0 \
  -timeout-prob=0.5 \
  -timeout-dur=5s

# Test specific error codes
./mayhem -target=http://localhost:3000 \
  -error-codes=503,504 \
  -error-prob=0.3
```
### When using Mayhem 

For chaos engineering, follow these best practices:

- Start Small
- Monitor Everything
- Test in Stages
- Use Realistic Values
- Document Findings

### FAQs

#### Mayhem Won't Start

1. Ensure the **target URL** is accessible.  
2. Check that the **specified port** is available and not in use.  
3. Confirm your **target service is running** before starting Mayhem.

#### No Chaos Being Injected

1. Verify that **probability values** are greater than `0`.  
2. Check that **chaos injection is enabled** in your configuration.  
3. Use the **statistics endpoint** to confirm requests are flowing through Mayhem.

#### Too Much Chaos

1. If your system is overwhelmed, **reduce the probability values**.  
2. **Disable specific chaos types** (e.g., delay, error, timeout) through the configuration endpoint.

### Debugging

Use the management endpoints to debug issues:

```
# Check if requests are flowing through Mayhem
curl http://localhost:8080/_chaos/stats

# Verify configuration
curl http://localhost:8080/_chaos/config

# Confirm Mayhem is healthy
curl http://localhost:8080/_chaos/health
```

Tip: The logs will also show when chaos is being injected, helping you understand the impact on your system.
